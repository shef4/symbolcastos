2. **Creative Assistance**:
   - Generating text, art, or music.
   - Assisting in Symbol Cast programming with real-time suggestions.
3. **Education**:
   - Helping users learn programming or other skills.
   - Providing tutorials for navigating Symbol Cast OS.
4. **Accessibility Support**:
   - Voice commands for users with physical limitations.
   - Real-time translation for multilingual users.
5. **Collaboration**:
   - Suggesting ideas during group projects.
   - Acting as mediators in team workflows.

## Integration Architecture

Symbol Cast OS provides an extensible architecture to integrate third-party AI agents:

### **Key Components**
1. **Agent API**:
   - Enables communication between the OS and AI agents.
   - Facilitates task delegation, data retrieval, and result display.
2. **Symbol Cast Language Hooks**:
   - Allows users to summon AI agents via gestures or commands.
   - Example: Drawing a "lightbulb" symbol could summon an idea-suggestion agent.
3. **Agent Manager**:
   - Manages installed AI agents.
   - Handles lifecycle events (activation, suspension, termination).
4. **Secure Sandboxing**:
   - Ensures agents operate in isolated environments to protect user data and system integrity.

### **Data Flow**
1. **Invocation**: User invokes an AI agent via gesture, voice, or command.
2. **Processing**: The agent processes the request using its model or logic.
3. **Response**: The agent returns the result to the OS, which displays it in the appropriate context.
