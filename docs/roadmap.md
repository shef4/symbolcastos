# Symbol Cast OS Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for Symbol Cast OS, including milestones and timelines for the project. The roadmap focuses on achieving the goals of creating a cross-platform operating system that integrates Symbol Cast's gesture-based language, supports diverse user needs, and operates on both advanced and older hardware.

## **Project Stages**

### **Stage 1: Proof of Concept (0-1 Month)**
- **Goals**:
  - Implement gesture-based activation (e.g., double-tap to activate the canvas).
  - Develop a basic frosted glass canvas for symbol drawing.
  - Set up hash-based symbol recognition for simple symbol processing.
  - Create a basic memory stack for managing system and user-defined symbols.
  - Design preliminary Minimal and Informative modes for the UI.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Basic UI for symbol input.
  - Working system for saving and recognizing symbols.
  - Initial documentation for Symbol Cast language syntax.

---

### **Stage 2: Alpha (1-3 Months)**
- **Goals**:
  - Train and integrate machine learning models for symbol recognition.
  - Expand the Symbol Cast language to support loops, conditionals, and custom functions.
  - Integrate third-party AI agents for basic collaboration tasks.
  - Enhance accessibility features (voice commands, high-contrast modes, screen reader support).
  - Refine Minimal and Informative modes based on initial testing.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Working Symbol Cast interpreter with core language constructs.
  - AI agent integration prototype.
  - Usable Minimal and Informative modes in the UI.

---

### **Stage 3: Beta (3-6 Months)**
- **Goals**:
  - Develop the immersive virtual world desktop environment.
  - Expand AI collaboration capabilities (e.g., intelligent suggestions, automated tasks).
  - Conduct extensive user testing across different demographics (e.g., elderly, disabled).
  - Optimize the OS to run efficiently on older and rudimentary hardware.
  - Integrate seamless platform support for phones, tablets, laptops, and VR.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Beta version of the OS with functional virtual world desktop.
  - Fully integrated Minimal and Informative modes.
  - Optimized system for older devices.
  - User feedback for further refinement.

---

### **Stage 4: Release Candidate (6-9 Months)**
- **Goals**:
  - Finalize all features and ensure cross-platform compatibility.
  - Complete documentation for developers and end-users.
  - Implement robust security and privacy measures for AI agents and user data.
  - Address user feedback from the beta phase.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Release candidate version of Symbol Cast OS.
  - Comprehensive documentation for developers and users.
  - Security and privacy enhancements.

---

### **Stage 5: Public Launch (9-12 Months)**
- **Goals**:
  - Launch the open-source project on platforms like GitHub.
  - Build a community of developers and contributors.
  - Provide regular updates and maintenance based on user feedback.
  - Promote Symbol Cast OS in Japan and other target markets.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Publicly available Symbol Cast OS.
  - Community engagement through forums and contributions.
  - Marketing materials and user guides.

---

## **Future Goals**

### **Version 2.0+**
- **Advanced AI Integration**:
  - Build a marketplace for third-party AI agents.
  - Enable AI-to-AI collaboration on tasks.
- **Hardware Development**:
  - Develop hardware optimized for Symbol Cast OS.
  - Explore VR-first hardware for immersive virtual desktop environments.
- **Global Expansion**:
  - Target international markets with localized language and cultural adaptations.
- **Sustainability**:
  - Continue optimizing the OS for older hardware to support environmental sustainability.
