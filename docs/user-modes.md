1. **Minimal Mode**: A clean, simple interface designed for ease of use and reduced distractions.
2. **Informative Mode**: A detailed, guidance-focused interface that provides all instructions and context upfront.

## **Informative Mode**

### Features

## **Mode Switching**

Users can switch between Minimal and Informative modes dynamically through:

### User Preferences
- Preferences are stored in a configuration file or user profile, ensuring the OS remembers the selected mode across sessions.
